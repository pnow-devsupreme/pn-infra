[2025-10-07 10:36:04] [INFO]: Command: ansible-playbook -i "/home/devsupreme/work/pn-infra/v0.2.0/bootstrap/scripts/../ansible/inventory/production.yml" -v "/home/devsupreme/work/pn-infra/v0.2.0/bootstrap/scripts/../ansible/playbooks/post-install-infrastructure.yml"
No config file found; using defaults
ERROR! couldn't resolve module/action 'k8s_exec'. This often indicates a misspelling, missing collection, or incorrect module path.

The error appears to be in '/home/devsupreme/work/pn-infra/v0.2.0/bootstrap/ansible/playbooks/post-install-infrastructure.yml': line 118, column 11, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:
